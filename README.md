# Learning ML

This repository contains my hands-on learning and experiments in machine learning.

## Day 1 – NumPy Foundations
In this notebook I worked with:
- NumPy arrays and matrices
- Feature-wise mean and standard deviation
- Data normalization
- Matrix multiplication used in ML models

These are the building blocks of machine learning systems.
