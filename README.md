# Learning-ML

This repository contains my hands-on work and experiments while learning machine learning.

It includes:
- Data processing and feature engineering
- Numerical computing with NumPy
- Working with real-world datasets
- Machine learning model experiments

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a specific concept or task commonly used in real ML systems.
